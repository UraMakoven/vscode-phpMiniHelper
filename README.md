This plugin automatically adds symbol ">" next to "-" written by you in the php variable. Also this plugin can type "->" instead of "." written by you.  

# for example

you type \$this-, then you will get \$this->
you type \$this., then you will get \$this->

you type [... "name" =, then you will get "name" =>

**Enjoy!**
