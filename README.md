This plugin automatically adds symbol ">" next to "-" written by you in the php variable. Also this plugin can type "->" instead of "." written by you.  

# for example

(*automatic addition ">"*) you type **\$this-**, then you will get **\$this->**
(*automatic addition ">"*) you type **\$this.**, then you will get **\$this->**
(*automatic addition ">"*) you type [... **"name" =**, then you will get **"name" =>**

(*automatic fix ">>"*) you type **\$this->>**, then you will get **\$this->**
(*automatic fix ">>"*) you type **"name" =>>**, then you will get **"name" =>**

**Enjoy!**
